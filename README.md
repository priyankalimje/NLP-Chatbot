# NLP-Chatbot

**Project Title** :- Implementation of Chatbot using NLP

**Problem Statement** :- The problem in meeting these expectations is common to most Indian restaurants known for their diversities in cuisines and flavors. Customers often request instant browsing of menus, customized order-taking, tracking the delivery process, or knowing festive deals. Traditional approaches to customer service are likely to prove deficient in these services, making for long waiting, incomplete response, and customer dissatisfaction. High volumes of inquiries overstretch resources, making manual handling time-consuming and prone to human error, while many establishments do not have a scalable solution for 24/7 support.

**Problem Description** :- "The Indian food website faces challenges in providing efficient customer support and personalized user interactions. With a diverse and extensive menu featuring regional and traditional dishes, customers often struggle to explore options, place orders, or find specific dietary preferences.The chatbot system for a fast food restaurant website is designed to handle a variety of tasks, including food ordering, menu exploration, outlet location, order tracking, and FAQ responses. The architecture is modular to ensure scalability and maintainability."

**Disclaimer** :- This project is a conceptual design for an NLP-based chatbot tailored for an Indian food website. It is intended for educational and illustrative purposes only. While every effort has been made to ensure the feasibility and technical soundness of the system, actual implementation may require additional considerations, such as compliance with data protection regulations, integration with proprietary APIs, and addressing specific business needs. The proposed solution assumes certain technical and operational capabilities that may vary depending on the actual deployment environment.
